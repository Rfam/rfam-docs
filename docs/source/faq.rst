What are "seed" and "full" alignments?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two kinds of Rfam multiple sequence alignments:

1. The **seed** alignment is a hand-curated alignment of known members of the family. This alignment may not contain
all known members of a family, but rather a representative set.
We use the `Infernal <http://eddylab.org/infernal/>`_ software to build a covariance model
from this alignment.

2. The covariance model is used to search the :ref:`glossary:rfamseq` sequence database
for other family members and build a **full** alignment including all instances of a family.
Starting with Rfam 12.0 the full alignments are no longer provided by Rfam, but they can
be generated as described in the following `protocol <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6754622/>`_.

What do the scores for hits to Rfam models mean?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you search a sequence against Rfam and obtain a hit to one of our families,
we report the start and end coordinates of the matching region, the orientation of the match,
and the bit score. The bit score (also known as the log-odds score ) is generated
by the Infernal software when it tries to match your sequence to the model.
In very simple terms, it is a measure of how well your sequence matches the model;
the higher the bit score, the better your sequences fits the model.

More specifically the bit score is the log\ :sub:`2`\  of the probability
of the query sequence given the model, over the probability of the sequence given the null model:

   :alt: Bit score formula

In theory this means that positive bits scores are significant but, in practice,
more conservative cutoffs are used as the size of the database means we can observe hits
with low positive bits scores by chance.
(See the `Infernal user guide <http://eddylab.org/infernal/Userguide.pdf>`_ for more information.)

Where does your secondary structure annotation come from?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ideally, when we build a seed alignment, the initial secondary structure annotation
is obtained from the literature. In these cases the secondary structure is usually available
only for a few of the member sequences in the seed. Our aim is to generate models
that represent conserved secondary structure, so when we begin to expand the membership of the seed
to be as representative as possible, we will only retain the secondary structure annotation
that is conserved between the majority of sequences. You should also note that the annotations
obtained from the literature may be experimentally validated or they may be RNA folding predictions
(commonly `MFOLD <http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold>`_). We do not discriminate
between the two and you will need to refer to the original publications to clarify.

In those cases where no secondary structure prediction is available in the literature,
but where we have good set of seed sequences, we frequently use a local installation
of the `WAR software <http://genome.ku.dk/resources/war/>`_ which allows us to cherry pick
the best alignment and secondary structure prediction from multiple tools.
Historically, the folding prediction tools used has varied and the method used will be indicated.

You can find the alignment and structure source for each family in the curation tab,
or in the SE and SS lines in the Stockholm file. Where the source is obtained from the literature,
we will provide the PubMed identifier (PMID). You should also note that the seed alignments
often get updated between releases and may be manually adjusted by the curator.
As a result, attempts to obtain the same structure using the same prediction method,
may not return exactly the same structure as shown on the Rfam SEED alignment.
We usually indicate where the a structure has been manually edited.

What is your definition of an RNA family?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We will group sequences into a "family" where we can identify sequence or secondary structure conservation
using our covariation models. This is decided when we build our seed alignment
and search the CM against rfamseq. From the resulting searches we decide where the cutoff threshold should be.

When we set this cut off threshold, we are essentially deciding that any sequences
that score above the threshold are true, homologous members of the family,
whilst those below are "chance hits". This discrimination between true and false is usually very clear
if we have a representative seed alignment.

Occasionally, for various biological reasons, it can be extremely difficult
to get good resolution between true and false predictions. In such case
we make an informed decision on where the cutoff should be. As a result, some families
may contain false positives (often pseudogenes) or may also lose some true positives
below the threshold. In such cases we will have made the best choice we can in order to limit
the false positive and loss of true positives. If you have queries about the membership of any of our families,
please :ref:`contact-us:Contact us` and we will try to clarify or resolve the problem.

How can I tell which are predicted and which are experimentally confirmed sequences?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to do this, since we do not add a source tag
to each individual sequence in either our seed or full alignments.
All of our families (seed alignments) are based on one or more experimentally validated
exemplars of the family, but the majority of the other member sequences are added
by homology search and manual curation. We have high confidence in these members of the seed alignment
that we use to build the covariance model and computationally predict
other possible members in the nucleotide database.

You can study the descriptions of sequences extracted from the EMBL nucleotide database,
occasionally this contains useful information about function.

Why is my favourite sequence not in the family?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The most likely reason is that it is not in the EMBL release that rfamseq is based on.
With each major release, e.g. 8.0, 9.0, we update the underlying nucleotide database.
You can check which version we are currently using `here <http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Rfam/CURRENT/README>`_.
If, however, your sequence is in the relevant EMBL release but is still absent from a relevant family,
it is possible that our model may need to be improved.
Please :ref:`contact-us:Contact us` with the relevant information and we will decide
whether the sequence should indeed be included and, if so, we will try to improve our model.

Where can I find out more about RNA sequence analysis/covariance models/SCFGs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The `Infernal <http://eddylab.org/infernal/>`_ software package,
which is an essential companion to the Rfam database, now has extensive documentation,
along with some description of how covariance models work for RNA sequence analysis.
Background and theory can also be found in the excellent book
`Biological Sequence Analysis <http://eddylab.org/cupbook.html>`_ by Richard Durbin, Sean Eddy, Anders Krogh,
and Graeme Mitchison (Cambridge University Press, 1998). For more references see :ref:`citing-rfam:Citing Rfam`.

Searching
---------

How can I find information about a particular RNA family?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can do this in several ways. If you already know the Rfam accession
or name of the family, you can use the "jump to" boxes on the home page
or any tabbed page in the website. Alternatively, if you're not sure of the family
accession or correct name and want to try a broad-ranging search, you should use the "keyword" search box
in the header of each page. This search allows the use of ambiguous terms
and will search multiple sections of the database for a match to your query term.
The results page will give you a list of all the families with matches and you can follow the links
to the summary page for each family.

If you're not even sure of your query term and simply want to browse our families,
click on the "browse" link in the header of every page. This takes you to an index
that lists all Rfam families according to accession and ID and links directly to the summary page for each family.

How can I search my DNA sequence for non-coding RNA genes?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Both our `single sequence <http://rfam.org/search>`_ and
`batch <http://rfam.org/search?tab=searchBatchBlock#tabview=tab1>`_ searches
allow you to search a nucleotide sequences against the Rfam model library.
Any hits to Rfam families will be returned with start and end coordinates,
orientation and a score for each hit.

For short single sequences, our `single sequence <http://rfam.org/search>`_ search tool
will return Rfam matches to your sequence interactively. However, if your sequence is longer than 2Kbp,
we suggest that you fragment it into smaller, overlapping segments and use the
`batch search <http://rfam.org/search?tab=searchBatchBlock#tabview=tab1>`_ facility.
You might find `this tool <http://emboss.bioinformatics.nl/cgi-bin/emboss/splitter>`_
useful for splitting large sequences into fragments.

Finally, if you have a very large number of sequences to search, you may find it
most convenient to download and run Rfam locally
(see section :ref:`genome-annotation:Genome annotation` for more information).

Downloading
-----------

What do the sequence identifiers in your alignments mean?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The identifier **"AY033236.1/563-353"** means that the EMBL accession is "AY033236",
the sequence version is "1" (optional), the start coordinate is "563" and the end coordinate is "353",
the strand is given by the order of the coordinates, in this case it is negative.

How can I view or download a family alignment?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
From the family summary page, go to the "Alignments" tab on the left side panel.
The alignments tab will give you multiple drop down options on how to either view
or download the seed sequences for this family, in an aligned or fasta format.
The formatting options allow you to select which type of format you would prefer.

If the alignment is very large the formatting tool may not be suitable and you may prefer
to use the preformatted alignment in Stockholm format. A number of Stockholm alignment re-formatters
and viewers exist, such as the sreformat program from the `HMMer package <http://hmmer.org>`_
and the `RALEE <http://sgjlab.org/ralee/>`_ major mode for Emacs.
You can read more about Stockholm format on `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_format>`_.

As of release 12.0, we no longer provide full alignments for automatic download.
You can generate them using the Sunbursts feature for sequences of your choice
(for families with full alignments containing less than 1000 sequences),
or generate them yourself by downloading the covariance model and using the Infernal suite of software.

If you are interested retrieving alignments for multiple families, you can
download all our seed alignments in Stockholm format flat-files, and the covariance models
used to generate them, from our `ftp site <http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Rfam/CURRENT>`_.

How can I download a domain-specific subset of covariance models?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The `rfam-taxonomy <https://github.com/Rfam/rfam-taxonomy>`_ project on GitHub contains a list of domain-specific Rfam families.
For example, you can access Bacteria-specific or Virus-specific Rfam families and generate a domain-specific subset of covariance models
that can be used with the Infernal software to scan genomes or any other sequences.

How can I download a subset of sequences from a family?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unfortunately, this has not been implemented yet. There are plans in place
to modify the underlying Rfam database to allow this.

How can I download all Rfam sequences for my favourite species?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unfortunately, this has not been implemented yet. Please :ref:`contact-us:Contact us` if you need help.

The "Taxonomy" tab on the search page will allow you to perform taxonomic queries.
In fact, this function also allows you to search with queries from internal nodes
of the NCBI taxonomic tree. However, the results are only returned on the family level,
not the sequence level.

Rfam and Infernal
-----------------

How do I filter Infernal output by Rfam family type?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes it is useful to filter Infernal output based on Rfam family type, for
example, if you are only interested in rRNA families.

1. `Get a list of Rfam families <http://rfam.org/search#tabview=tab4>`_
for each RNA type (see :ref:`searching-rfam:Search by entry type`).

  For example, selecting the **rRNA** checkbox gives the following list:

  .. code-block:: none

    RF00001	5S_rRNA	Gene; rRNA
    RF00002	5_8S_rRNA	Gene; rRNA
    RF00177	SSU_rRNA_bacteria	Gene; rRNA
    RF01118	PK-G12rRNA	Gene; rRNA
    RF01959	SSU_rRNA_archaea	Gene; rRNA
    RF01960	SSU_rRNA_eukarya	Gene; rRNA
    RF02540	LSU_rRNA_archaea	Gene; rRNA
    RF02541	LSU_rRNA_bacteria	Gene; rRNA
    RF02542	SSU_rRNA_microsporidia	Gene; rRNA
    RF02543	LSU_rRNA_eukarya	Gene; rRNA
    RF02545	SSU_trypano_mito	Gene; rRNA
    RF02546	LSU_trypano_mito	Gene; rRNA
    RF02547	mtPerm-5S	Gene; rRNA
    RF02554	ppoRNA	Gene; rRNA
    RF02555	hveRNA	Gene; rRNA

2. Create a file on your computer called ``rfam-ids.txt`` with a list of Rfam ids:

  .. code-block:: none

    RF00001
    RF00002
    RF00177
    RF01118
    RF01959
    RF01960
    RF02540
    RF02541
    RF02542
    RF02543
    RF02545
    RF02546
    RF02547
    RF02554
    RF02555

  .. TIP::

    If you would like to download the list of RNA families and types
    as text, click **Show the unformatted list** at the bottom of the
    `search results page <http://rfam.org/search#tabview=tab4>`_.
    Then copy and paste into an editor and save the file for example
    as ``rfam-types.txt``. You can then create the ``rfam-ids.txt``
    file with the command ``cat rfam-types.txt | awk '{ print $1 }' > rfam-ids.txt``.

3. Use the `grep <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>`_ command to filter Infernal results.

  For instance, given an Infernal *tblout* file ``results.tblout``
  (`example file <https://gist.githubusercontent.com/AntonPetrov/b7a3c27201d020449332815113ee294a/raw/d924423e179b55986ab477d3b776ac72ec08994c/results.tblout>`_),
  run this command:

  .. code-block:: bash

    grep -f rfam-ids.txt results.tblout

  It will print only the lines from ``results.tblout`` that contain Rfam ids
  specified in ``rfam-ids.txt``.

  Alternatively, if you want to **exclude** some families from your analysis,
  you can use the following command:

  .. code-block:: bash

    grep -v -f rfam-ids.txt results.tblout

  This will print only the lines that **do not** contain Rfam ids listed in
  ``rfam-ids.txt``.

You can use this procedure to filter Infernal results by **any** set of Rfam families.
For example, you can get a list of Rfam families using :ref:`searching-rfam:Taxonomy search`
and get Infernal search results from families found in a specific taxonomic group.

I would like to submit a family
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Great! We are very keen for the community to help keep us updated on new families.
Ideally, a new family for Rfam should contain elements (RNA sequences)
that have some known functional classification, are evolutionarily conserved
and have evidence for a secondary structure. The families should not solely be based
on prediction only, e.g. RNAz, EvoFold, or QRNA predictions, nor solely on transcriptomic data,
e.g. tiling array or deep sequencing. For more detailed information on how to submit a family,
please read the rest of the Rfam documentation but, if you have any queries, please do :ref:`contact-us:Contact us`.

If your family is sufficiently interesting, or if you have several of them,
you may be interested in publishing your family in the RNA families track
that is available through the `RNA Biology <http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/krnb20/current>`_ journal.

How can I edit a SEED alignment?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We do not currently provide public access to edit our alignments.
This is advantageous in that it maintains our standard of alignments and structures,
but, if you feel our seed alignment/structure annotations can and should be improved,
please :ref:`contact-us:Contact us`, preferably supplying us with a new alignment, in Stockholm format,
and we will do our best to incorporate the improvements.
