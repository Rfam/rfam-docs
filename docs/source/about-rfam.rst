About Rfam
==========

The `Rfam <http://rfam.org>`_ database is a collection of RNA sequence families of
structural RNAs including non-coding RNA genes as well as
cis-regulatory elements. Each family is represented by a multiple
sequence alignment and a covariance model (CM).

You can use the `Rfam website <http://rfam.org>`_
to obtain information about an individual family, or browse
the families and genome annotations. Alternatively you can download
all of the Rfam data from the `FTP site <https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Rfam/CURRENT>`_.
Find out more about the project by exploring the latest :ref:`citing-rfam:Rfam references`.

For each family Rfam provides:

**Summary page**
  Textual background information on the RNA family, which we obtain from
  the online encyclopedia Wikipedia

**Seed alignment**
  A curated alignment containing a small set of representative sequences
  and a consensus secondary structure annotation

**Sequences**
  Information about sequences in the family, including bit score, seed
  and full alignments, region coordinates, sequence description from
  the EMBL nucleotide database, and the species name

**Secondary structure**
  Secondary structure images, annotated with various measures of sequence
  and structure conservation

**Species**
  Interactive tree graphic displaying species distribution for the full
  alignment.

**Trees**
  Phylogenetic trees are available for the seed and the full alignment

**Structures**
  Mappings between PDB structures and Rfam annotations

**Database references**
  Links to external databases and references to other data sources

**Curation**
  Covariance model files contain information summarising
  the family, including the author of alignment, references for
  sources of sequence and/or structure, the number of sequences in each
  alignment, score thresholds and score distributions
