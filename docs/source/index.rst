We choose CC0 because:

* It is most in line with the spirit of EMBL-EBI’s Terms of use and places data in the public domain without constraints. We believe that this approach to research data sharing strengthens open science and scientific progress.

* It is the best way to encourage remixing and reuse as it makes clear to any user – academic, commercial or otherwise – that the data are not owned by anyone and therefore can be used freely.

* It saves researchers time when reusing the data, which speeds up the process of science.
